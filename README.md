## Project 
The purpose of this project is to create a TIC TAC TOE game using Python language.


## Rules
The program will start by asking the names of the 2 players.
First player plays with "X".
Second player plays with "O".
The program will randomly choose the player who is going to start the game.
At each round, the program will ask the player at which cell he wants to play in the 3x3 cells boards.
The first player to fill the condition of a 3 full cells wins the game.
